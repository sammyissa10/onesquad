<objective>
Update template data with narrative project copy and video URL infrastructure, then redesign the portfolio page structure with dark hero, light grid section, and dark CTA — establishing the Dark -> Light -> Dark rhythm.

Purpose: The data layer must have narrative copy and video URLs before the card component can use them. The page bookends (hero + CTA) set the visual identity independent of the grid/card work.
Output: Updated templateData.ts with narrative descriptions + video URLs for all 21 templates. Portfolio page.tsx with redesigned hero and CTA sections.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add narrative copy and video URL fields to template data</name>
  <files>src/lib/templateData.ts</files>
  <action>
Update the TemplateData interface to add two new fields:
- `narrative: string` — 1-2 sentence story-based tagline for each template (shown on hover)
- `videoUrl?: string` — optional path to video preview file (WebM format, will be populated later with actual videos)

Write narrative copy for ALL 21 templates. Each narrative should be:
- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Story-driven, not feature-driven ("Built for a barbershop that wanted to feel like a brand, not a business" style)
- Match the edgy creative tone established across the site
- Anti-template positioning: frame each template as a custom build for a real business type

Examples of the tone:
- modern-agency: "We built this for agencies tired of looking like every other agency. Clean lines, bold moves, zero templates."
- sharp-cuts: "Built for a barbershop that wanted to feel like a brand, not a business."
- shop-starter: "Your products deserve better than a Shopify default. This is the store that makes people buy."

Add videoUrl field with placeholder paths following the pattern: `/videos/templates/{template-id}.webm`
Only populate videoUrl for the 4 popular templates (modern-agency, shop-starter, health-first, biz-dashboard) — these will be the first to get actual video files. Leave videoUrl as undefined for the remaining 17 templates.

Do NOT change the existing description or longDescription fields — the narrative field is additive.
Do NOT modify the getTemplateBreakdown, getPriceTier, categories, categoryLabels, categoryGroups, or breakdownsByTier exports.
  </action>

Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no type errors.
Verify all 21 templates have a `narrative` field by searching for the string count.
Verify exactly 4 templates have a `videoUrl` field.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 21 templates have narrative story copy. TemplateData interface includes narrative and videoUrl fields. 4 popular templates have videoUrl paths. TypeScript compiles without errors.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Redesign portfolio page hero and CTA with Dark -> Light -> Dark rhythm</name>
  <files>src/app/portfolio/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Redesign the portfolio page structure to establish the 3-section Dark -> Light -> Dark rhythm.

**Dark Hero Section (top):**
- Navy background (bg-[#0F172A] or bg-primary-brand) — NOT the gradient hero
- Bold display typography: "Our Work Speaks. Loudly." as the main headline (text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-bold text-white)
- Subtitle: "Real sites. Real businesses. Zero templates. Every project below was built from scratch for someone who refused to settle." (text-lg md:text-xl text-white/70)
- Template count badge: "{templates.length} Projects" as a small coral/accent pill above the headline
- Varied padding: py-24 md:py-36 (generous, premium feel — not py-16)
- Remove the existing Breadcrumb component from inside the hero
- Add data-cursor="text" data-cursor-text="Explore" to the hero container for custom cursor interaction

**Light Grid Section (middle):**
- This section holds the filter bar and masonry grid (implemented in Plan 02)
- For now, keep the existing filter + grid code but change the Section background from "muted" to "white" (bg-card)
- The grid content will be replaced in Plan 02 — just set the section wrapper correctly
- Varied padding: py-20 md:py-28

**Dark CTA Section (bottom):**
- Replace the existing gradient rounded card CTA with a full-width dark section
- Navy background (bg-[#0F172A]) matching the hero
- Bold headline: "Don't See What You Need? Let's Build It." (text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold text-white)
- Subtitle: "Every business is unique. Your website should be too. Tell us what you're building and we'll make it real." (text-lg text-white/60)
- Two CTAs: Coral primary "Start a Project" linking to /contact, white outline "View Pricing" linking to /pricing
- Both buttons should have data-cursor="button" attributes
- Varied padding: py-24 md:py-32
- This is a standalone Section, NOT nested inside the grid section

Remove the existing `<Section background="gradient">` hero wrapper and the `<Breadcrumb>` component.
Remove the bottom CTA that's currently inside the grid section (the rounded gradient card).
Keep Header and Footer imports unchanged.

Import pattern: Keep using Container and Section from @/components/ui/Container.
For the dark sections, use `<section className="bg-[#0F172A] py-24 md:py-36">` directly (not the Section component, since it doesn't have a navy preset matching the exact color used across the site).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — page builds without errors.
Visually confirm: page has 3 distinct sections (dark hero, light middle, dark CTA).
Check hero text says "Our Work Speaks. Loudly."
Check CTA text says "Don't See What You Need? Let's Build It."
  </verify>
  <done>
Portfolio page has Dark -> Light -> Dark 3-section rhythm. Hero uses navy bg with bold display type. CTA is full-width dark section with "Let's Build It" messaging. Existing filter/grid still functional in the middle section (will be redesigned in Plan 02). Page builds without errors.
  </done>
</task>
