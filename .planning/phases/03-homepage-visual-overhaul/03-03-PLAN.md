<objective>
Complete the homepage visual overhaul by redesigning Testimonials (unique per-testimonial treatments), FAQ, and CTA sections, then verify the full page creates a cohesive visual rhythm. Includes visual verification checkpoint.

Purpose: Testimonials with unique treatments are a locked requirement. The CTA and FAQ complete the page flow. The checkpoint ensures the full homepage meets all 7 success criteria before moving to Phase 4.
Output: Three redesigned section components + updated page.tsx + visual verification of the complete homepage.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign Testimonials with unique per-testimonial treatments</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Testimonials.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely replace the current carousel testimonial with a bento-style grid where each testimonial has a UNIQUE visual treatment. This is a locked requirement — testimonials must NOT be identical cards.

**Section wrapper:**
- Background: `<section className="bg-peach/15 text-navy py-20 md:py-32">` (warm peach-tinted section — different from pure white or navy). Use Container inside.
- Do NOT use the Section component — use a raw section element for custom background.

**Heading:**
- `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-black`. Rewrite to edgy: "Real Talk From Real Clients" or "Don't Take Our Word For It. Take Theirs." Accent word in `text-coral`.
- Subtext: "No scripts. No stock photos. Just honest feedback." in `text-navy/60`.

**Testimonial grid (CSS Grid):**
- Use `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6` layout.
- Each testimonial gets a DIFFERENT style from a predefined array:

```typescript
const testimonialStyles = [
  {
    bg: "bg-coral",
    text: "text-white",
    quoteColor: "text-white/30",
    nameColor: "text-white",
    roleColor: "text-white/70",
    colSpan: "md:col-span-2",  // wide card
    padding: "p-10 md:p-12",
    rounded: "rounded-3xl",
  },
  {
    bg: "bg-navy",
    text: "text-white",
    quoteColor: "text-white/20",
    nameColor: "text-white",
    roleColor: "text-white/60",
    colSpan: "md:col-span-1",  // narrow card
    padding: "p-8",
    rounded: "rounded-2xl",
  },
  {
    bg: "bg-white",
    text: "text-navy",
    quoteColor: "text-coral/20",
    nameColor: "text-navy",
    roleColor: "text-navy/60",
    colSpan: "md:col-span-3",  // full-width card — different layout emphasis
    padding: "p-10 md:p-14",
    rounded: "rounded-3xl",
  },
];
```

- Each card shows: large decorative quote mark (text-6xl or text-7xl, using the quoteColor), the testimonial content in `text-lg md:text-xl`, author name (font-bold), role and company. Star ratings using filled Star icons matching the card's accent.
- Remove the carousel navigation (prev/next buttons, dots). Show all testimonials at once in the grid — carousels hide content and feel generic.
- Add hover: each card gets a subtle `hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform duration-300` (keeps scale pattern from Features but at a subtle level).
- Data attributes: `data-cursor="card"` on each testimonial card.
- Keep "use client" for Framer Motion. Use staggered entrance (useInView + motion variants).

**Key visual principle:** When someone scrolls to testimonials, each card should look like it was individually designed — different sizes, different colors, different padding. This is the anti-template approach.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run dev` and scroll to the testimonials section:
1. Three testimonials visible simultaneously (no carousel)
2. Each testimonial has a different background color (coral, navy, white)
3. Each testimonial has a different size (wide, narrow, full-width)
4. Large decorative quote marks are visible in each card
5. Peach-tinted section background creates warmth
6. Cards have subtle hover scale effect
  </verify>
  <done>
Testimonials.tsx shows all testimonials in a bento grid where each has unique background color, card size, padding, and typography treatment. Carousel is replaced with simultaneous display. Section has peach-tinted background.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Redesign FAQ and CTA sections, update page.tsx section order</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/HomeFAQ.tsx, src/components/sections/CTABanner.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**HomeFAQ.tsx — LIGHT section (white background):**

Update the FAQ section to continue the design language.

- Background: `<section className="bg-white text-navy py-16 md:py-24">` (moderate spacing). Use Container size="md" inside.
- Heading: `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold`. Rewrite: "The Stuff You're Probably Wondering" or "Questions? We've Got Answers. And Honesty." Keep the direct, no-BS tone. Subtext in `text-navy/60`.
- FAQ card wrapper: `bg-muted rounded-3xl p-6 md:p-10` (softer than current sharp shadow).
- FAQ items: Keep the accordion behavior but update styling:
  - Question text: `font-bold text-navy hover:text-coral transition-colors`
  - Answer text: `text-navy/70`
  - Dividers: `border-navy/10`
  - ChevronDown icon: `text-coral` when open, `text-navy/40` when closed
- Rewrite FAQ answers to be slightly edgier — keep the honest conversational tone but make it more confident.
- CTA at bottom: "Still have questions?" with accent button "Let's Talk" linking to /contact.
- Data attributes: Add `data-cursor="button"` on accordion question buttons.

**CTABanner.tsx — DARK section (navy background, bold closing):**

Transform the CTA into a bold, full-width dark closer.

- Background: Replace the Section + gradient card approach with a full-bleed section: `<section className="bg-navy text-white py-24 md:py-36">` (generous spacing for dramatic close). Use Container inside.
- Remove the inner rounded card — the entire section IS the dark block.
- Heading: `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-black`. Rewrite to bold closer: "Ready To Stop Guessing And Start Growing?" or "Let's Build Something That Actually Works." Accent word in `text-coral`.
- Subtext: `text-xl text-white/60`. Something like: "No 12-month contracts. No corporate jargon. Just results."
- Dual CTAs: Primary coral button "See Our Plans" (/pricing) + outline "Schedule a Call" (/contact). Both wrapped in MagneticButton.
- Trust indicators at bottom: Keep the green dots but update text to be punchier. Use `text-white/50` for muted feel.
- Keep entrance animation (useInView + stagger).

**page.tsx — Homepage section assembly:**

Update the section order to create optimal visual rhythm. The final order should be:

```
Hero (dark - navy)
Features (dark - navy)
ServicesPreview (light - white)
Comparison (dark - navy)
PortfolioPreview (light - peach tint)
Process (dark - navy)
Testimonials (light - peach tint)
HomeFAQ (light - white)
CTABanner (dark - navy)
```

This creates the rhythm: dark-dark-light-dark-light-dark-light-light-dark

The hero and features being back-to-back dark is intentional — they feel like one continuous dark opening block before the first light break. The two light sections before the dark CTA closer create a brief "breathing room" before the bold call to action.

If the current import order in page.tsx doesn't match this sequence, reorder the components in the JSX. Keep the same imports — just reorder the rendering.

No changes to Header/Footer wrapping or the main element structure.

  <name>Task 3: Visual verification of complete homepage</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
CHECKPOINT: Human visual verification of the complete homepage overhaul.

What was built across all 3 plans:
- Bento grid hero with oversized typography (Plan 01)
- Dark/light section alternation with varied spacing (Plan 02)
- 3+ distinct hover patterns: scale, glow, lift+shadow (Plan 02)
- Unique testimonial treatments per testimonial (Plan 03)
- Process with numbered narrative structure (Plan 02)
- All copy rewritten to edgy creative tone (Plans 01-03)
- Full page visual rhythm from hero to CTA (Plan 03)

How to verify:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000 (run `npm run dev` if not already running)
2. Scroll the ENTIRE homepage from top to bottom and verify these 7 success criteria:

   SC1: Hero has oversized display text (4-8rem) in an asymmetric bento grid layout
   SC2: Sections alternate between dark (navy) and light (peach/white) with hard color transitions
   SC3: Spacing varies across sections (some sections have more breathing room than others)
   SC4: Hover over Feature cards (scale), Service cards (glow), Comparison cards (lift+shadow) — 3 distinct patterns
   SC5: Headlines and body copy sound confident and edgy (not generic corporate)
   SC6: Testimonials section shows each testimonial with different colors/sizes (not identical cards)
   SC7: Process section has numbered structure with oversized step numbers

3. Test mobile: Resize browser to 375px width or use DevTools mobile view
   - Hero should stack gracefully
   - All sections readable without horizontal overflow
   - No broken layouts

4. Test hover interactions:
   - Feature cards should scale up slightly on hover
   - Service cards should show a coral glow effect on hover
   - Comparison cards should lift with shadow on hover
   - Custom cursor should react to data-cursor attributes

Resume signal: Type "approved" if all 7 criteria pass, or describe specific issues to fix.
