# Phase 3: Homepage Visual Overhaul - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign the homepage with asymmetric layouts, bold typography, strategic dark/light section alternation, varied hover states, and rewritten copy. This phase establishes the design language that later phases (4-7) will extend to other pages. Scroll-driven animations are Phase 8 — this phase focuses on layout, typography, color, hover, and copy.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Section Layout
- **Structure:** Asymmetric bento grid — oversized headline on one side, mixed-size visual blocks on the other (Kota.co.uk inspired)
- **Headline tone:** Bold capability statement — confident declaration of what OneSquad does (not provocative, not aspirational)
- **Hero height:** Full viewport (100vh) — hero owns the entire screen
- **Bento grid content:** Claude's discretion — best mix of brand imagery, stats, or visual elements based on available content and brand guide style
- **Background treatment:** Claude's discretion — pick what creates strongest first impression with the brand palette (Maastricht Blue #051733, Terra Cotta #e2795e, Macaroni & Cheese #FAB383, B'dazzled Blue #27598E)
- **CTA style:** Claude's discretion — pick style that contrasts best with the chosen hero background
- **CTA count:** Claude's discretion — single or dual CTAs based on layout fit
- **Entrance animation:** Claude's discretion — balance drama with speed
- **Bento block interactivity:** Claude's discretion — decide if hover interactions (glow, cursor text) add value or distract
- **Logo in grid:** Claude's discretion — use logo icon as a grid block if it works as a design element
- **Mobile adaptation:** Claude's discretion — stack, simplify, or headline-only based on what reads best

### Section Rhythm & Color
- Strategic dark/light alternation (decided in PROJECT.md) — navy and peach/light backgrounds with hard transitions
- Spacing varies intentionally across sections (not uniform py-16)
- At least 3 distinct hover patterns visible across the homepage

### Content Structure
- Testimonials must have unique treatments (individual colors/layouts, not identical cards)
- Process or service breakdown uses numbered/narrative structure where appropriate
- Success criteria from roadmap: 7 specific criteria must be met

### Copy Tone
- Edgy creative tone — all homepage copy (headlines + body) rewritten
- Bold capability positioning — matches the hero headline approach
- Brand slogan: "Unlock your digital potential"

### Claude's Discretion
- Bento grid block content mix
- Hero background color choice
- CTA button style and count
- Hero entrance animation approach
- Bento block hover interactivity level
- Logo icon placement in hero
- Mobile hero adaptation strategy
- Exact section ordering and count
- Specific hover pattern assignments per element type
- Typography scale and weight mixing across sections

## Specific Ideas

- Hero should feel like Kota.co.uk's hero — that exact asymmetric bento grid energy with oversized text and mixed blocks
- Brand palette from guide: Maastricht Blue (#051733), Terra Cotta (#e2795e), Macaroni & Cheese (#FAB383), B'dazzled Blue (#27598E)
- Primary typeface: Coolvetica; Secondary: Arial Rounded
- Logo: Two number 1s merging to create letter S in negative space — represents teams merging
- Inspiration sites established in PROJECT.md: kota.co.uk (layouts, bento grids) + strangepixels.co (cursor, dark theme, bold accents)
