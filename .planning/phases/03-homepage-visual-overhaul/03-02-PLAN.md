<objective>
Overhaul the five middle homepage sections (Features, ServicesPreview, Comparison, PortfolioPreview, Process) with dark/light alternation, varied spacing, 3+ distinct hover patterns, bold typography, and rewritten edgy creative copy.

Purpose: These sections create the visual rhythm of dark/light alternation, demonstrate varied hover patterns, and establish the edgy tone. Without them, the hero redesign feels disconnected from the rest of the page.
Output: Five completely redesigned section components with dark/light backgrounds, varied spacing, distinct hover patterns, and new copy.

  <files>src/components/sections/Features.tsx, src/components/sections/ServicesPreview.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Features.tsx — DARK section (navy background):**

Replace the current light-background value props section with a bold dark section.

- Background: Replace `Section background="white"` with a raw `<section>` element using `className="bg-navy text-white py-32 md:py-40"` (generous spacing — this is the first section after the hero, it needs breathing room). Do NOT use the Section component — its preset backgrounds don't include navy.
- Container: Keep using Container component inside for content width.
- Layout: Keep the current asymmetric 2-column layout (heading left, cards right) — it already works well.
- Heading: Increase to `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-black text-white`. Rewrite copy to edgy tone: "Why Businesses Ditch Their Old Agency For Us" (or similar bold claim). Subtext in `text-white/60`.
- Cards: Use `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10 rounded-2xl p-8`. Icon containers: `bg-coral/20` with coral icons.
- **Hover pattern 1 — SCALE:** Apply Framer Motion `whileHover={{ scale: 1.03 }}` with `transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}` on each card. This is the first distinct hover pattern.
- Data attributes: Add `data-cursor="card"` on each value prop card.
- Keep existing animation (useInView + stagger) but update to use white text colors.
- Typography: Section heading should be noticeably larger than the old version. Mixed weights: heading `font-black`, card titles `font-bold`, descriptions `font-normal text-white/70`.

**ServicesPreview.tsx — LIGHT section (white/cream background):**

Replace the muted background with a clean white section, visually contrasting against the dark Features above.

- Background: `<section className="bg-white text-navy py-20 md:py-28">` (tighter spacing than Features — varied rhythm).
- Heading: `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold`. Rewrite to edgy: "Everything You Need. Zero Bloat." or "Your Entire Digital Team. One Monthly Bill." Accent word in `text-coral`.
- Keep the dual-category layout (Web Solutions + Digital Marketing) but update card styling.
- **Hover pattern 2 — GLOW:** Replace the current `whileHover={{ y: -8 }}` with a CSS glow effect. Each service card gets a wrapper with:
  ```
  <div className="relative group">
    <div className="absolute -inset-1 bg-coral/20 rounded-3xl blur-xl opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300" />
    <div className="relative bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 border border-border ...">content</div>
  </div>
  ```
  This is the second distinct hover pattern (glow using pseudo-element opacity, NOT box-shadow animation per research pitfall #3).
- Category headers: Vary weight/size. "Web Solutions" at `text-2xl font-black` with blue bar, "Digital Marketing" at `text-xl font-bold` with coral bar. Different visual weight creates intentional variation.
- Service card descriptions: Rewrite shortDescription copy to be punchier and more confident. Do not just keep the existing safe copy.
- Data attributes: Keep existing `data-cursor="card"` and `data-cursor-text="View"` on service cards.

Run `npm run dev` and scroll the homepage:
1. Features section has navy background with white text — hard transition from hero
2. ServicesPreview section has white background — hard transition from Features
3. Hovering Feature cards triggers scale effect
4. Hovering Service cards triggers glow effect (coral glow around card)
5. Neither hover uses animated box-shadow (check DevTools Performance panel if unsure)
6. Both sections have new, edgier headlines
7. Typography sizes vary between the two sections
  </verify>
  <done>
Features.tsx uses navy dark background with scale hover pattern. ServicesPreview.tsx uses white light background with glow hover pattern. Headlines rewritten to edgy creative tone. Spacing differs between sections (py-32/py-40 vs py-20/py-28). Two distinct hover patterns implemented.

  <name>Task 2: Redesign Comparison, PortfolioPreview, and Process with continued rhythm</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Comparison.tsx, src/components/sections/PortfolioPreview.tsx, src/components/sections/Process.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Comparison.tsx — DARK section (navy background):**

Transform the comparison section into a bold dark section.

- Background: Replace Section component with raw `<section className="bg-navy text-white py-24 md:py-36">` (different spacing from Features dark section). Use Container inside.
- Heading: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black`. Rewrite: "What Changes When You Stop Doing It Alone" or "The Before & After Nobody Shows You". Accent word in `text-coral`.
- "Without Us" column: Keep red tones but adapt for dark bg. Cards: `bg-red-500/10 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl`. Text: `text-red-300` for titles, `text-red-200/70` for descriptions.
- "With Us" column: Cards: `bg-coral/10 border border-coral/20 rounded-xl`. Text: `text-coral` for titles, `text-white/70` for descriptions.
- Center divider: Adapt gradient for dark background.
- Keep existing scroll-driven parallax (useScroll/useTransform) for the column slide-in — it's already good.
- **Hover pattern 3 — LIFT + SHADOW:** On comparison cards, add `whileHover={{ y: -6 }}` with a CSS transition for shadow: `hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-coral/10 transition-all duration-300`. This is the third distinct hover pattern (lift with shadow, distinct from pure scale or glow).
- Typography: Vary from other sections — use `text-4xl` not `text-5xl` for heading (each section heading should feel slightly different).

**PortfolioPreview.tsx — LIGHT section (peach-tinted background):**

Transform into a warm peach-tinted section for visual variety (not just alternating white/navy).

- Background: `<section className="bg-peach/10 text-navy py-16 md:py-24">` (tighter spacing — creating rhythm variation).
- Heading: `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold`. Rewrite: "Real Sites. Real Businesses. Zero Templates." or "Built Different. Every Time." Accent in `text-coral`.
- Keep the template grid cards from TemplateGridCard but update the section wrapper.
- Portfolio cards should inherit the glow hover from their TemplateGridCard component (or add lift hover if TemplateGridCard doesn't have hover effects).
- Typography: Slightly smaller heading than other sections (`text-3xl md:text-4xl` instead of `text-4xl md:text-5xl`) — intentional variation.
- Data attributes: Ensure template cards have `data-cursor="card"`.

**Process.tsx — DARK section (navy background):**

Transform the process timeline into a bold dark numbered narrative.

- Background: `<section className="bg-navy text-white py-28 md:py-40">` (generous spacing for the narrative to breathe).
- Make it a "use client" component (add directive) so Framer Motion can be used.
- Heading: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black`. Rewrite: "Four Steps. No Bureaucracy. No Surprises." Subtext: `text-white/60`.
- Numbers: Make the step numbers OVERSIZED as a design element. Each `step.number` ("01", "02", etc.) should be `text-7xl md:text-8xl font-black text-white/5` positioned behind the step content as a watermark-style background number. This creates the numbered/narrative structure required by COPY-08.
- Step content: Against the dark bg, use `text-white` for titles and `text-white/60` for descriptions.
- Timeline line: `bg-white/10` vertical line. Step icons on the line get `bg-coral/20` backgrounds with coral-colored icons.
- Step descriptions: Rewrite to be even punchier and more direct. Keep the honest, no-BS tone.
- Add staggered entrance animation using useInView + motion variants.

2. Spacing varies: py-32, py-20, py-24, py-16, py-28 — no two adjacent sections have same padding
3. Comparison cards have lift+shadow hover effect (third pattern)
4. Process section shows oversized numbers as design elements
5. All copy has been rewritten with edgy, confident tone
6. Section headings vary in size across sections
