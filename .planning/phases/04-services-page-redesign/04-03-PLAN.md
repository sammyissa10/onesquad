    - "Hover interactions work on service cards (glow on DM, lift+shadow on WS)"

<objective>
Visually verify the services overview page and at least 2 service detail pages (one from each category) to confirm the redesign meets Phase 4 success criteria.

Purpose: Phase 4 requires visual rhythm, unique layouts, and edgy copy — all of which require human eyes to verify. The build may pass but the visual experience must feel intentionally designed.

Output: Human-verified approval or specific issue list for fixes.

Present the complete services page redesign for human visual verification. Start dev server if not already running (`npm run dev`).

What was built across Phase 04 Plans 01 and 02:

**Services Overview Page (/services):**

- Digital Marketing section (light/white) with 6 service cards using glow hover pattern
- Web Solutions section (dark/navy) with 4 service cards in asymmetric bento layout using lift+shadow hover
- Peach-tinted CTA section at bottom

**Service Detail Pages (/services/[slug]):**
- 7-section layout per service: Hero (dark) -> Features (light) -> Results (dark) -> Why Choose (peach) -> Related (dark) -> FAQ (light) -> CTA (dark)
- Custom edgy tagline per service (10 unique taglines)
- Oversized result metrics in coral
- FAQ accordion with coral accents
- Related services linking to same-category services
- All 10 pages statically generated
