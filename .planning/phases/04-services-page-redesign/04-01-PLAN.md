<objective>
Redesign the services overview page (/services) with a bold hero section, two distinct category layouts (Digital Marketing and Web Solutions), and a closing CTA — applying the dark/light rhythm, varied spacing, bold typography, and hover patterns established on the homepage in Phase 3.

Purpose: The current services page uses identical card grids for both categories and lacks the visual personality established on the homepage. This plan creates unique section treatments per category so no two areas feel templated.

Output: 3 new section components (ServicesHero, DigitalMarketingGrid, WebSolutionsGrid) and a recomposed services/page.tsx.

Create three new section components for the services overview page. Each must be a "use client" component using Framer Motion for entrance animations. Follow the established patterns from Phase 3 (staggered entrance with useInView, brand color tokens from globals.css, data-cursor attributes on interactive elements).

**ServicesHero.tsx** — DARK section (navy background):
- Full-width navy section: `<section className="bg-navy text-white py-28 md:py-40">` (generous spacing like homepage hero)
- Container for content width
- Oversized headline with coral accent: Use `text-4xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl xl:text-display font-black` for the main headline. Example headline: "Digital Services That Actually Move The Needle" with "Move The Needle" in `text-coral`. The tone should be bold and direct, not aspirational.
- Subtext in `text-white/60 text-xl`: Something like "Two categories. Ten services. One team that knows your name." — short, punchy, no corporate fluff.
- Two category jump buttons (not navigation tabs — simple anchor links): A coral Button linking to `#digital-marketing` ("Digital Marketing") and an outline (white border) Button linking to `#web-solutions` ("Web Solutions"). Wrap each in MagneticButton. Add `data-cursor="button"` to each.
- Staggered entrance animation: Use stagger(0.12) container with fadeIn item variants from `@/lib/animations`. Wrap with useRef + useInView.

**DigitalMarketingGrid.tsx** — LIGHT section (white background):
- White section: `<section id="digital-marketing" className="bg-white text-navy py-20 md:py-28">` (tighter spacing than hero — varied rhythm)
- Container for content width
- Category header: "Marketing That Actually Works" with a coral bar accent (same pattern as ServicesPreview.tsx category headers: `<span className="w-12 h-1 bg-coral rounded-full" />`). Use `text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black`.
- Subtext: Edgy line like "Forget vanity metrics. We build campaigns that put people through your door." in `text-navy/60`.
- 6 service cards in a `grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` layout (compact grid).
- Each card: Use the GLOW hover pattern from ServicesPreview.tsx (outer `absolute -inset-1 bg-coral/20 rounded-3xl blur-xl opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300` + inner `relative bg-white rounded-2xl p-6 border border-gray-200`).
- Card content: `DynamicIcon` in a `bg-coral/10` circle that transitions to `bg-coral` on hover (icon transitions to white). Service title (font-bold), `shortDescription` text, and 3 result metrics displayed as small pills/badges (`bg-coral/5 text-coral text-xs rounded-full px-2 py-0.5`). Link the entire card to `/services/${service.slug}` using Next.js Link.
- Add `data-cursor="card"` and `data-cursor-text="View"` on each card.
- Filter services using `services.filter(s => s.category === "digital-marketing")` from `@/lib/constants`.
- Staggered entrance: useRef + useInView + stagger(0.08) container + fadeIn items.

**WebSolutionsGrid.tsx** — DARK section (navy background):
- Navy section: `<section id="web-solutions" className="bg-navy text-white py-24 md:py-36">` (different spacing from DM section — varied rhythm)
- Container for content width
- Category header: "Web Solutions Built To Last" with a blue bar accent (`bg-blue`). Use `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-black`.
- Subtext: Edgy line like "Your website is your 24/7 salesperson. We make sure it actually closes." in `text-white/60`.
- 4 service cards in an ASYMMETRIC bento layout using CSS Grid: `grid-cols-2 gap-6` where Web Design (first card) spans `col-span-2` (wide hero card) and the remaining 3 are standard single-column cards. This creates visual hierarchy without making any service "more important."
- Each card: Use the LIFT+SHADOW hover pattern from Comparison.tsx (`whileHover={{ y: -6 }}` + `hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-blue/10 transition-all duration-300`).
- Card style: `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10 rounded-2xl p-8` (translucent dark cards matching Features section style).
- Card content: `DynamicIcon` in `bg-blue/20` circle, service title in `text-white font-bold text-xl`, full `description` (not shortDescription) in `text-white/60`, and all 3 result metrics displayed prominently (`text-2xl font-bold text-blue` for metric, `text-white/50 text-sm` for description). Link entire card to `/services/${service.slug}`.
- The hero card (Web Design, col-span-2) should have larger padding (p-10), larger title (`text-2xl`), and arrange metrics horizontally in a row. Standard cards stack metrics vertically.
- Add `data-cursor="card"` on each card.
- Filter services using `services.filter(s => s.category === "web-solutions")` from `@/lib/constants`.
- Staggered entrance: useRef + useInView + stagger(0.1) container + fadeIn items.

**index.ts** — Add exports for the 3 new components to the sections barrel file. Keep all existing exports intact.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — should compile with no errors. Verify the 3 new files exist and the barrel file exports them. Check that no existing exports in index.ts were removed.
  </verify>
  <done>
Three new section components exist with distinct visual treatments: ServicesHero (dark/bold), DigitalMarketingGrid (light/glow hover), WebSolutionsGrid (dark/bento/lift+shadow hover). All use brand color tokens, Framer Motion entrances, and data-cursor attributes. Barrel file updated.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Recompose Services Overview Page with New Sections and CTA</name>
  <files>
    src/app/services/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Replace the current services/page.tsx entirely. The current page uses a single ServicesContent component with identical card grids — replace with the new section-based composition.

**Page structure:**
```
Header
  ServicesHero        (dark - navy)
  DigitalMarketingGrid (light - white)
  WebSolutionsGrid    (dark - navy)
  CTA Section         (light - peach tinted)
Footer
```

**Section rhythm:** dark -> light -> dark -> light (alternating, same approach as homepage)

**CTA Section** — Build inline (not a separate component, it's page-specific):
- Peach-tinted section: `<section className="bg-peach/10 text-navy py-20 md:py-28">` — uses peach tint for variety (not white, not navy — creates a warm closing).
- Container for content width, centered text.
- Headline: `text-3xl md:text-5xl font-black` — something like "Ready To Stop Doing Everything Yourself?" with coral accent on a key phrase.
- Subtext: `text-navy/60 text-lg` — "Tell us about your business. We'll show you what's possible."
- Two CTAs: coral "See Our Plans" Button (link to /pricing) + outline "Get a Free Quote" Button (link to /contact). Wrap both in MagneticButton.
- Framer Motion entrance: initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }} whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }} viewport={{ once: true }}.

**Important:**
- Remove `"use client"` if possible (Section components are client components, the page can be a server component that just composes them). However, if the inline CTA uses Framer Motion (it does), the page must be "use client". That is fine.
- Remove the old ServicesContent component, containerVariants, itemVariants, and the old Breadcrumb import.
- Import Header, Footer from `@/components/layout`.
- Import ServicesHero, DigitalMarketingGrid, WebSolutionsGrid from `@/components/sections`.
- Import Button from `@/components/ui/Button`, MagneticButton from `@/components/ui/MagneticButton`, Link from `next/link`.
- Import Container from `@/components/ui/Container`.
- Do NOT import or use Section or Breadcrumb (the new design doesn't need the generic Section wrapper — each section component handles its own styling, and breadcrumbs are removed for cleaner design).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — should compile with no errors. The services page route should be generated successfully. Run `npm run dev` briefly and verify the page loads at http://localhost:3000/services without console errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
Services overview page is recomposed with 4 distinct sections: dark hero, light DM grid, dark WS bento, light peach CTA. Page has visual rhythm with dark/light alternation, varied spacing, and edgy copy throughout. Old identical card grids are gone.

- Hero has oversized typography and category jump buttons
- All service cards link to detail pages
- Build passes with zero errors
