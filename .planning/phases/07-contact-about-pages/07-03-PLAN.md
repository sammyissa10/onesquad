<objective>
Visual verification checkpoint for both contact and about page redesigns to confirm they meet Phase 7 success criteria.

Purpose: Both pages are design-intensive with specific visual requirements (asymmetric layouts, typography-driven values, warm form UX) that cannot be verified by build output alone. Human verification confirms the redesign achieves the intended feel.

Output: Verified contact and about pages ready for Phase 8 scroll animation integration.

  <action>
Present the complete contact and about page redesigns for human visual verification. Start dev server if not already running (`npm run dev`).

What was built across Phase 07 Plans 01 and 02:

**Contact Page (/contact):**
- Dark hero with bold left-aligned headline "Let's Build Something Together."
- Asymmetric 12-col grid layout: 4-col sidebar with contact info + 8-col form area
- Warm humanized form with budget and timeline select fields
- Restyled quote summary card with coral accents (visible if you visit /pricing first and configure a quote)
- Dark CTA section with alternative paths (portfolio + pricing links)

**About Page (/about):**
- Typography-driven editorial layout — oversized headlines carry the page
- Mission-first dark hero: "We Don't Do Average."
- Logo origin story section with decorative brand mark
- Full-width typographic value statements: "We Remember Your Name", "We'd Rather Say No", "We Never Stop Learning"
- Peach editorial section: "Small Team. Big Standards."
- Manifesto closer / CTA section

**Verification Steps:**

**Contact Page — Visit http://localhost:3000/contact:**
1. Dark navy hero is visible with bold left-aligned headline (not centered)
2. Form and sidebar are side-by-side on desktop (sidebar left, form right)
3. Contact info items (email, location, hours) have coral icon containers that change on hover
4. Budget Range and Timeline select dropdowns are present in the form
5. Form intro text is warm ("Tell Us About Your Project", "The more you tell us...")
6. Submit button spans full width with coral accent
7. Dark CTA section at bottom offers alternative paths (Portfolio + Pricing)
8. Resize to mobile (375px): layout stacks to single column, no horizontal overflow
9. (Optional) Visit /pricing, configure a quote, then revisit /contact — quote card should appear with coral styling

**About Page — Visit http://localhost:3000/about:**
1. Dark navy hero with oversized headline "We Don't Do Average."
2. No stats section anywhere on the page (no number counters)
3. Logo story section has text on left, decorative coral/peach gradient block on right
4. Values section (dark background) has oversized typography, NOT icon cards
5. Each value ("We Remember Your Name", "We'd Rather Say No", "We Never Stop Learning") uses coral accent on the key word
6. Peach-tinted editorial section: "Small Team. Big Standards."
7. Dark manifesto closer with dual CTAs (Start a Project + See Our Work)
8. Resize to mobile (375px): all text scales down, single column, no overflow
9. Scroll through page — entrance animations trigger on scroll

**Cross-cutting:**
10. Both pages have no Breadcrumb component
11. Custom cursor reacts to interactive elements on both pages
12. Both pages use dark/light section rhythm (not uniform backgrounds)

Wait for user approval. Type "approved" if both pages look good, or describe specific issues to fix.
