<objective>
Redesign the about page with a typography-driven editorial layout where oversized type carries the page, values are bold statements (not generic cards), and the overall tone is a manifesto — not a corporate "about us."

Purpose: The about page must feel like a creative agency's editorial statement. Typography is the hero, not images or icons. Values should read like convictions, not marketing copy. The stats section is removed entirely per user decision.

Output: Fully redesigned `src/app/about/page.tsx` with dark hero, mission section, typography-led values, and manifesto/CTA closer.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign about page with typography-driven editorial layout and manifesto values</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely rewrite src/app/about/page.tsx with a typography-driven editorial layout. Remove ALL existing content — this is a full redesign. No stats section. No icon cards. Typography carries the page.

**Cleanup — Remove these imports/usages:**
- Remove `stats` import from constants.ts (no longer needed)
- Remove `Target, Heart, Award, Zap` icon imports from lucide-react (no icons needed)
- Remove `Image` import from next/image (no images on this page)
- Remove `Breadcrumb` import and usage
- Remove `fadeIn, stagger` imports from animations.ts (use inline variants instead for editorial timing)
- Remove the existing `values` array constant
- Keep: `useRef` from react, `motion, useInView` from framer-motion, `Link` from next/link
- Add: `Button` import from @/components/ui/Button
- Keep: `Header, Footer` from @/components/layout
- Keep: `Container` from @/components/ui/Container (use it for width control only, NOT Section component — this page uses custom section backgrounds)

**Page Structure — 5 sections with editorial dark/light rhythm:**

**Section 1: Dark Hero (bg-[#0F172A], py-28 md:py-40)**
- Mission-first approach (NOT origin story — user decision gives discretion, and mission sets the tone immediately)
- Headline: "We Don't Do Average." in text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-[6rem] xl:text-display font-black text-white leading-[0.9] tracking-tight
- Below headline, mission statement as large supporting text: "We're a small squad building digital empires for businesses that refuse to blend in. No templates. No shortcuts. Just work that actually works." in text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/70 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mt-8
- data-cursor="text" data-cursor-text="Read On" on the hero section div
- Staggered entrance: parent uses staggerChildren: 0.15, children from opacity:0, y:40 with easing [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]

**Section 2: Logo Origin Story (bg-card, py-24 md:py-36)**
- Integrate the "Two Become One" story in a typography-forward way (NOT image-heavy)
- Left-aligned asymmetric layout using CSS Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-8 lg:gap-16`
- Left column (lg:col-span-7):
  - Small eyebrow: "The Story" in text-sm font-semibold text-coral uppercase tracking-widest mb-6
  - Headline: "Two Become One." in text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-black text-navy leading-[0.9] tracking-tight mb-8
  - Story paragraphs in text-lg text-navy/70 leading-relaxed, space-y-6:
    - "Our logo tells the story of who we are. Two number 1s merge together to form the letter S in negative space — symbolizing the union of two teams becoming one."
    - "When you partner with OneSquad, your team and our team unite with a single mission: your digital success. We're not just another vendor. We become an extension of your business."
    - "This philosophy drives everything — how we communicate, how we approach projects, and how we measure success. Hint: we measure it by yours."
- Right column (lg:col-span-5):
  - Large decorative element: a div with `aspect-square bg-gradient-to-br from-coral to-peach rounded-3xl flex items-center justify-center`
  - Inside: "1S" text in text-[8rem] md:text-[10rem] font-black text-white/20 select-none (decorative brand mark, oversized and ghosted)
  - data-cursor="card" on this block
- Animate with useInView (once: true, margin: "-100px"), entrance from opacity:0, y:30

**Section 3: Values — Typography Statements (bg-[#0F172A], py-28 md:py-40)**
- NO icon cards. NO 3-column grid. Each value is a FULL-WIDTH typographic statement.
- Each value gets its own block, stacked vertically with generous spacing (space-y-20 md:space-y-28)
- **Value 1: "We Remember Your Name."**
  - Headline: text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-[5.5rem] font-black text-white leading-[0.9] tracking-tight
  - "Your Name." is wrapped in `<span className="text-coral">` for accent
  - Supporting text below (mt-6): "You're not a ticket number. Your account manager knows your business, your goals, and what keeps you up at night. We build relationships, not just websites." in text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/50 max-w-3xl leading-relaxed
- **Value 2: "We'd Rather Say No."**
  - Same headline scale, "Say No." in coral accent
  - Supporting: "If something won't work for your business, we'll tell you straight. We'd rather lose a sale than waste your money on something that won't deliver. That's not noble — it's just good business." in text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/50 max-w-3xl leading-relaxed
- **Value 3: "We Never Stop Learning."**
  - Same headline scale, "Learning." in coral accent
  - Supporting: "The digital world moves fast and we move with it. What worked last year might not work today. We stay sharp so you don't have to — and we bring those insights to every project." in text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/50 max-w-3xl leading-relaxed
- Each value block animates in with whileInView: opacity 1, y: 0, from opacity: 0, y: 50, viewport once: true, transition duration: 0.7, ease [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]
- Stagger the three values naturally through scroll distance (no artificial delay — the spacing handles it)

**Section 4: What Makes Us Different (bg-peach/10, py-20 md:py-28)**
- A short, punchy editorial section that replaces stats with attitude
- Single column, centered, max-w-4xl mx-auto
- Headline: "Small Team. Big Standards." in text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-black text-navy leading-[0.9] tracking-tight text-center mb-10
- Three short statements as a list, not cards. Each is a `<p>` with text-lg md:text-xl text-navy/70 leading-relaxed, separated by space-y-6:
  - "We're deliberately small. No account managers playing telephone. No junior devs learning on your dime. When you hire OneSquad, you get the people who actually do the work."
  - "We take on fewer projects so we can give each one the attention it deserves. Your business isn't a line item — it's our focus."
  - "And yeah, we remember your name. Every single time."
- Animate entire block with whileInView from opacity:0, y:30

**Section 5: Manifesto Closer / CTA (bg-[#0F172A], py-24 md:py-36)**
- Manifesto-style closer that doubles as CTA
- Headline: "Ready to Join the Squad?" in text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-black text-white leading-[0.9] tracking-tight text-center
- "the Squad" can optionally be coral accent: `<span className="text-coral">the Squad</span>`
- Supporting: "Let's stop talking about what we could build and start building it." in text-xl text-white/60 text-center mt-6 mb-10
- Dual CTAs centered:
  - Coral primary: "Start a Project" -> /contact (Button variant="accent" size="lg")
  - White outline: "See Our Work" -> /portfolio (Button variant="outline" size="lg" with className="border-white text-white hover:bg-white hover:text-navy")
- Both buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Animate from opacity:0, y:30 on whileInView

**Copy tone calibration:**
- Somewhere between rebellious and warm (per user decision)
- Specific and concrete (not vague buzzwords)
- First person plural ("we", "our")
- Confident without being arrogant
- Examples of what to AVOID: "excellence", "innovative", "world-class", "cutting-edge", "solutions", "synergy"
- Use contractions naturally ("we're", "don't", "won't")

**Important implementation notes:**
- Do NOT use Section component for any section on this page — use manual `<section>` tags with explicit bg/py classes for full editorial control over spacing and backgrounds
- Use Container component inside each section for width control (size="xl" or size="lg" as appropriate)
- bg-[#0F172A] for dark sections (3 sections: hero, values, CTA) — consistent with portfolio page
- bg-card for logo story section
- bg-peach/10 for the editorial section (warm accent)
- All spacing is intentionally varied: py-28/40, py-24/36, py-28/40, py-20/28, py-24/36 — NOT uniform
- Use `MotionConfig` with `reducedMotion="user"` wrapping the page for accessibility (import from framer-motion)
