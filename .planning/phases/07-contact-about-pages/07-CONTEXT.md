# Phase 7: Contact & About Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign the contact page and about page with unique layouts completing the site-wide visual overhaul. Both pages must break the templated patterns and feel intentionally designed. Existing functionality (contact form submission, quote integration from pricing) must continue working.

## Implementation Decisions

### Contact Page — Layout & Structure
- Detailed but warm form — more fields (budget, timeline, service type) styled to feel human, not corporate
- Keep existing form fields and add warmth through styling, not field reduction
- Quote summary integration from pricing calculator preserved (restyle to match new design)

### Contact Page — Sections
- Hero, form area with sidebar info, and CTA section — all at Claude's discretion for layout approach
- Contact info (email, location, hours) included but presentation is flexible
- Bottom CTA (links to pricing) kept or removed based on page flow judgment

### About Page — Narrative Style
- Mission & values editorial approach — bold statements about what OneSquad stands for
- Typography-driven visuals — oversized type carries the page, less imagery, more attitude
- No stats/social proof section — keep it personal, let the work speak for itself

### About Page — Sections
- Hero, story section, values, CTA — all at Claude's discretion for how to structure
- Logo origin story ("Two Become One") can be integrated, kept, or cut based on editorial flow
- Values ("remember your name", "rather say no", "keep learning") presented as typography-led statements, not generic cards
- CTA or manifesto closer at Claude's discretion

### About Page — Copy Tone
- Claude decides tone — matching the narrative structure, somewhere between rebellious/bold and warm/genuine as fits the editorial style

### Claude's Discretion
- Contact page layout style (split-screen, full-width, etc.)
- Contact page hero headline and approach
- Contact sidebar info presentation and content
- Quote card restyling approach
- Whether to keep contact CTA section
- About page hero approach (origin story vs mission-first)
- How to handle logo story section (integrate, keep, or cut)
- Values presentation details
- What replaces stats section (if anything)
- About page closer style (CTA vs manifesto)
- About page copy tone calibration
- Dark/light section rhythm for both pages
- Hover patterns assignment for both pages

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- About page should be typography-driven (user explicitly chose this) — lean on bold type, not photos
- Mission & values editorial (user explicitly chose this) — manifesto energy, not corporate "about us"
- No stats or social proof on about page (user explicitly chose this) — personal and story-driven
- Contact form should feel "detailed but warm" (user explicitly chose this) — more fields are fine if the experience feels human
- Both pages use the established design system: dark/light rhythm, varied spacing, coral/navy/peach palette, distinct hover patterns
