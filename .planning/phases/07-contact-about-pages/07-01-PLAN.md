<objective>
Redesign the contact page with a unique asymmetric bento-inspired layout, warm humanized form with budget/timeline fields, restyled quote integration card, and dark/light section rhythm.

Purpose: Contact page must feel inviting and human, not generic. The layout must break the uniform section pattern established across other pages while preserving all existing form submission functionality and quote integration from the pricing calculator.

Output: Fully redesigned `src/app/contact/page.tsx` with dark hero, asymmetric form+sidebar layout, warm copy, and coral-accented quote card.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign contact page with asymmetric layout, warm form, and restyled quote card</name>
  <files>src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely rewrite src/app/contact/page.tsx with the following structure. All existing functionality (form submission via /api/contact, quote integration from localStorage, form validation with react-hook-form + zod) MUST be preserved exactly as-is. This is a visual/structural redesign, not a functional change.

**Schema Changes:**
Add `budget` and `timeline` fields to the contactSchema:
- `budget: z.string().optional()` — Budget range select
- `timeline: z.string().optional()` — Project timeline select

Add budget options array:
```
[
  { value: "", label: "What's your budget range?" },
  { value: "under-5k", label: "Under $5,000" },
  { value: "5k-10k", label: "$5,000 - $10,000" },
  { value: "10k-25k", label: "$10,000 - $25,000" },
  { value: "25k-plus", label: "$25,000+" },
  { value: "not-sure", label: "Not sure yet" },
]
```

Add timeline options array:
```
[
  { value: "", label: "When do you need this?" },
  { value: "asap", label: "As soon as possible" },
  { value: "1-2-months", label: "1-2 months" },
  { value: "2-3-months", label: "2-3 months" },
  { value: "flexible", label: "Flexible / No rush" },
]
```

**Page Structure — 3 sections with dark/light rhythm:**

**Section 1: Dark Hero (bg-[#0F172A], py-24 md:py-36)**
- Remove Breadcrumb component entirely (per established pattern from Phase 06)
- Left-aligned headline (NOT centered), max-w-3xl
- Headline: "Let's Build Something Together." in text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-black text-white leading-[0.9]
- Coral accent on "Together." using `<span className="text-coral">`
- Subtext: "You've got the vision. We've got the skills. Tell us what you're dreaming up and we'll make it real." in text-xl text-white/70
- data-cursor="text" data-cursor-text="Say Hi" on the hero container
- Staggered entrance animation (staggerChildren: 0.12, each item from opacity:0, y:30)

**Section 2: Form + Sidebar (bg-card, py-20 md:py-32)**
- Asymmetric CSS Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-8 lg:gap-12`
- **Sidebar (lg:col-span-4):** Contact information
  - Heading: "Other Ways to Reach Us" in text-2xl font-bold text-navy
  - Subtext: "Not a form person? We get it." in text-navy/60
  - Contact info items (email, location, hours) using the existing contactInfo array
  - Each item: 48x48 rounded-xl bg-coral/10 icon container with coral icon (w-5 h-5), label in text-sm text-navy/60, value in font-semibold text-navy
  - On hover: bg-coral/10 container transitions to bg-coral, icon becomes text-white (group-hover pattern)
  - Quick response badge at bottom: "We Respond Within 24 Hours" in a p-5 bg-navy/5 rounded-2xl box with coral accent
  - data-cursor="card" on each contact info link
  - Animate in with initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }} transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.2 }}

- **Form Area (lg:col-span-8):**
  - Form intro above fields: "Tell Us About Your Project" as text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-navy mb-2, followed by "The more you tell us, the better we can help. No pressure — we'll get back to you within 24 hours." in text-navy/60 mb-8
  - **Restyled Quote Summary Card** (if quoteData exists and !isSubmitted):
    - Wrapper: `mb-8 p-6 bg-coral/10 border-2 border-coral/20 rounded-2xl`
    - Header row: 48x48 rounded-full bg-coral flex center with "$" text-white text-xl font-bold, then "Your Quote Summary" text-lg font-bold text-navy + "From the pricing calculator" text-sm text-navy/60
    - Service line items: flex justify-between text-sm, service name text-navy/80, subtotal font-semibold text-navy
    - Total row: border-t-2 border-coral/20 pt-3 mt-3, "Estimated Total" text-navy font-bold text-lg, total in text-coral font-bold text-xl
    - Entrance animation: initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.98 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  - Form fields with generous spacing (space-y-6):
    - Row 1 (2-col grid on sm+): Name ("Your Name *", placeholder "Jane Smith", helperText "What should we call you?"), Email ("Email Address *", placeholder "jane@yourcompany.com")
    - Row 2 (2-col grid on sm+): Phone ("Phone Number", placeholder "+1 (555) 123-4567"), Company ("Company Name", placeholder "Acme Inc.")
    - Row 3 (2-col grid on sm+): Service select (existing serviceOptions), Budget select (new budgetOptions)
    - Row 4: Timeline select (new timelineOptions, full width)
    - Row 5: Message textarea ("Your Message *", placeholder "Tell us about your project — the more detail the better...", rows={6})
    - Submit button: Button variant="accent" size="lg" className="w-full" with Send icon, text "Send Message" / "Sending..."
    - Privacy note below: "By submitting, you agree to our Privacy Policy. We'll respond within 24 hours — no automated replies, just real people." centered, text-sm text-navy/50
  - Success state (isSubmitted): Keep the existing CheckCircle success state but restyle:
    - 80x80 rounded-full bg-coral/10 with CheckCircle text-coral (not green)
    - "Message Sent!" in text-2xl font-bold text-navy
    - "Thanks for reaching out. We'll get back to you within 24 hours with a real, human response." in text-navy/60
    - "Send Another Message" button variant="outline"
  - Animate form area in with initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }} animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }} transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: 0.3 }}

**Section 3: Alternative CTA (bg-[#0F172A], py-20 md:py-28)**
- Instead of generic CTA, offer alternative paths
- Headline: "Not Ready to Commit?" in text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white
- Subtext: "That's cool. Browse our work or check the pricing calculator — no pressure, no sales pitch." in text-white/70 text-lg
- Dual CTAs:
  - Coral primary: "Explore Our Work" -> /portfolio (Button variant="accent" size="lg")
  - White outline: "View Pricing" -> /pricing (Button variant="outline" size="lg" with white border/text styling)
- Both buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Center-aligned, max-w-2xl mx-auto

**Important implementation notes:**
- Import CheckCircle from lucide-react (keep existing import)
- Remove MessageSquare import (no longer used)
- Keep ALL existing form logic: useForm, zodResolver, onSubmit handler, localStorage quote reading, quote clearing after submission
- Add budget and timeline to the schema and the submission payload
- Use bg-[#0F172A] for dark sections (per Phase 06 pattern, NOT Section background="gradient")
- Use bg-card for the form section (per Section background="white")
- Remove the Breadcrumb import and usage
- All interactive elements get data-cursor attributes: "button" for buttons/links, "card" for contact info items
- Labels should use text-base font-semibold text-navy (warmer than default text-sm)

To update labels to feel warmer, override the Input/Select/Textarea label styling by wrapping them and passing className overrides where the Input component supports it, OR simply override at the form level by not using the label prop and instead adding manual labels above each field with the warmer styling. However, the simpler approach: the Input component already has label prop — use it as-is since the visual warmth comes from spacing, copy, and layout rather than label font size changes. Keep using the component's built-in label styling for consistency.

1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors
2. Run `npm run build` — page builds successfully
3. Verify the contact page has 3 sections (dark hero, light form, dark CTA) by searching for bg-[#0F172A] (should appear 2x) and bg-card (should appear in form section)
4. Verify budget and timeline fields exist: grep for "budgetOptions" and "timelineOptions"
5. Verify quote card restyling: grep for "Your Quote Summary" and "border-coral"
6. Verify Breadcrumb is removed: grep should NOT find "Breadcrumb" in the file
7. Verify form submission still works: grep for "fetch.*api/contact" (POST handler preserved)
  </verify>
  <done>
