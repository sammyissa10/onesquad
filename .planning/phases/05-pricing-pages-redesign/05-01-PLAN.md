<objective>
Redesign the pricing overview page (/pricing) as a bold gateway to the three tier calculators, replacing the current identical PricingCard tab layout with personality-driven tier preview cards that give visitors a taste of each calculator's distinct energy.

Purpose: The overview page is the entry point to all pricing. Currently it uses tabs with identical PricingCard components (hosting vs managed) — the most templated pattern possible. Transform it into a hybrid gateway that keeps the hosting/managed plans but introduces 3 distinct tier preview cards that link to the calculators, each hinting at the tier's personality.

Output: Redesigned `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` with navy hero, personality-driven tier gateway, refreshed hosting/managed section, and edgy copy throughout.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign pricing overview hero and tier gateway section</name>
  <files>src/app/pricing/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` with a completely new visual approach. The page structure should be:

**Section 1: Hero (navy bg, py-32 md:py-40)**
- Oversized headline using font-heading: "Stop Guessing. Start Building." or similar edgy tagline
- Text should use text-5xl md:text-6xl xl:text-7xl scale, white text with coral accent span
- Subheading: confident, direct copy — not "Choose the plan that fits" corporate speak. Something like "Three ways to level up. Each one built different."
- Keep the annual/monthly billing toggle but restyle it with a pill toggle on navy bg (white/10 backdrop)
- Remove the old gradient Section background — use bg-navy directly with full-width styling

**Section 2: Tier Gateway Cards (white bg, py-24 md:py-32)**
Each tier gets a DISTINCT card treatment — this is the core visual differentiation:

Social Media card:
- Layout: Compact, energetic — rounded-3xl with scale hover (whileHover scale: 1.03)
- Visual: Coral accent stripe at top, playful emoji or social icons cluster
- Headline: "Social Media" in bold, subtext like "Feed the algorithm. Own the conversation."
- "From $300/mo" price anchor
- CTA: "Build Your Package" coral button
- data-cursor="card"

Website card:
- Layout: Taller, more spacious — rounded-3xl with glow hover (boxShadow coral 80px 30%)
- Visual: Navy/5 subtle background tint, elegant thin border
- Headline: "Websites" in bold, subtext like "Crafted to convert. Designed to impress."
- "From $700" price anchor
- CTA: "Configure Your Site" outline button with coral hover
- data-cursor="card"

E-commerce card:
- Layout: Wide, data-driven feel — rounded-3xl with lift+shadow hover (y:-8, boxShadow navy/15)
- Visual: Gradient border (coral to peach), bold price display
- Headline: "E-Commerce" in bold, subtext like "Built to sell. Scaled to grow."
- "From $1,500" price anchor
- CTA: "Build Your Store" accent button
- data-cursor="card"

All cards link to their respective /pricing/{tier} page via Next.js Link.
Cards grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8, with the middle card (website) slightly taller using -mt-4 on desktop for visual hierarchy.

**Section 3: Hosting & Managed Plans (navy bg, py-24 md:py-32)**
- Keep the tab switching between hosting and managed plans
- Restyle the tab bar: navy background with white text, active tab gets coral underline (not pill bg)
- PricingCard redesign: remove the uniform whileHover y:-8, instead use lift+shadow hover on hosting cards and glow hover on managed cards
- Headings in white, feature text in white/70
- Card backgrounds: bg-white/5 with border border-white/10 (glass effect on dark bg)
- Plan highlighted state: ring-2 ring-coral instead of ring-accent
- Remove the "Included with every plan" strip — fold those into a small line at the bottom of the section

**Section 4: FAQ (white bg, py-20 md:py-28)**
- Keep FAQ accordion functionality
- Restyle: rounded-3xl bg-muted container, coral accent on active question
- Edgy section heading: "Questions? We've Got Answers." or similar
- CTA below: "Still overthinking it? Let's talk." with coral button

**Animation approach:**
- Replace containerVariants/itemVariants with custom variants:
  - Hero: fade up with stagger 0.15, duration 0.6, cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
  - Tier cards: staggered scale-in from 0.95, duration 0.4
  - Hosting cards: staggered fade-up y:40, duration 0.5
- Use MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" wrapping the main content

**Copy tone:** Confident, slightly irreverent. Not "Transparent Pricing. No Surprises." — more like "Stop Guessing. Start Building." Avoid corporate-safe language. The copy should feel like it was written by people who build things, not a marketing committee.

Keep all existing data imports (pricingPlans, includedWithEveryPlan, faqs). Keep the FAQ schema.org structured data. Keep formatPrice utility usage.

  <verify>
Run `npx next build` — page compiles without errors. Run dev server and visit /pricing — hero renders with navy background, 3 distinct tier cards are visible, tabs switch between hosting/managed, FAQ accordion works. Verify mobile layout stacks to single column at sm breakpoint.
  </verify>
  <done>
Overview page has: (1) navy hero with oversized bold typography and billing toggle, (2) 3 visually distinct tier gateway cards with different hover patterns linking to calculators, (3) redesigned hosting/managed tab section on dark background with glass cards, (4) restyled FAQ with edgy copy. No two sections share identical card or animation patterns. Mobile layout collapses to single column.
  </done>

<verification>
- Visit /pricing and confirm 4 distinct sections with dark/light rhythm (navy, white, navy, white)
- Hover each tier card — social scales, website glows, ecommerce lifts+shadows
- Click each tier card — navigates to /pricing/social, /pricing/website, /pricing/ecommerce
- Switch hosting/managed tabs — plans render correctly
- Resize to mobile — all sections stack to single column
- Check copy — no corporate-safe language remains
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Overview page serves as a bold gateway with 3 visually distinct tier previews. No identical card patterns. Dark/light rhythm applied. Copy is edgy and confident. All links and tab functionality preserved.
