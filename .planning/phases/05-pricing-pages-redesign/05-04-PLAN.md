<objective>
Redesign the e-commerce pricing calculator (/pricing/ecommerce) with a revenue-focused, growth-driven personality — spring animations, data emphasis, and ambitious copy. The layout uses a split-screen approach (live summary left, configuration right) that feels like a business dashboard. Then verify all 4 pricing pages are visually distinct.

Purpose: E-commerce is the highest-value tier ($1,500 base). Its visual personality should reflect ambition and ROI focus — this is for businesses that want to sell, scale, and grow. The data-driven layout with live preview reinforces the message that every dollar configured is an investment in revenue.

Output: Completely redesigned `src/app/pricing/ecommerce/page.tsx` with split-screen layout, spring animations, lift+shadow hover effects, and results-driven copy. Visual verification of all 4 pricing pages.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign e-commerce calculator with revenue/growth personality</name>
  <files>src/app/pricing/ecommerce/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely rewrite `src/app/pricing/ecommerce/page.tsx` while preserving all calculator state logic (designComplexity, productOptions, paymentGateways, shippingOptions, additionalFeatures, languageOptions, supportPlans, deliveryTimes, BASE_PRICE, settings state, toggleFeature, calculateTotal).

**CRITICAL: Preserve all state management and calculation logic exactly as-is.** Only change the visual presentation layer.

**Personality: Revenue/Growth**
- Energy: Confident, data-driven, ambitious
- Animation timing: spring physics (stiffness 100-200, damping 15-20), layout animations on price changes
- Hover pattern: Lift+shadow (whileHover y: -8, boxShadow "0 20px 40px rgba(5, 23, 51, 0.15)") on ALL interactive cards
- Copy tone: Results-driven ("Scale your revenue", "Built to sell", "Every feature drives conversion")

**Layout Structure: Split-screen (live preview left, config right)**
This is the KEY differentiator from social (full-width) and website (sidebar right). Replace the sidebar+main grid with:
- `grid lg:grid-cols-2 gap-0` — true 50/50 split
- LEFT side: Live preview/summary panel — sticky, always visible, shows running total and selected features as a dashboard
- RIGHT side: Configuration wizard — scrollable, step-by-step options
- On mobile: summary collapses to a compact sticky header bar at top

**Section 1: Hero (gradient bg, py-28 md:py-36)**
- bg-gradient-to-br from-navy via-navy to-blue/80 — gradient hero unique to this tier
- Subtle grid pattern overlay (bg-[url] with CSS grid dots or use a gradient mesh effect with navy/blue tones)
- ShoppingCart icon: large (w-20 h-20), in a gradient circle (coral to peach)
- Headline: "Built to Sell. Scaled to Grow." — text-5xl md:text-6xl xl:text-7xl, white
- Coral accent on "Sell"
- Subtext: "Configure your online store. Every feature you add drives revenue." — text-xl, white/70
- Optional stat badges floating in hero: "Avg 3x ROI", "500+ stores launched" — bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm text-white/60

**Section 2: Calculator (white bg, py-0 — no vertical padding, the split-screen IS the section)**
- Full viewport-height split-screen area
- min-h-[calc(100vh-200px)] to ensure impact

LEFT panel (live preview/dashboard):
- bg-navy rounded-none lg:rounded-l-3xl (only rounded on left edge when side-by-side)
- Sticky: lg:sticky lg:top-20 lg:h-[calc(100vh-5rem)]
- Content inside with p-8 lg:p-10
- Header: "Your Store" in text-2xl font-heading text-white, ShoppingCart icon
- Investment display: "Total Investment" label in white/50, then price in text-5xl font-bold text-coral
- AnimatePresence on price changes — spring animation, number scales briefly
- Feature breakdown: vertical list of selected features as pills/tags
  - Each selected item: bg-white/10 rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm text-white/80
  - Items animate in/out with layout animation (Framer Motion layout prop)
  - Unselected items don't show (clean, minimal)
- Progress indicator at bottom: circular or bar showing "Step X of 3"
- "Starting at $1,500" anchor in white/40 text at bottom

RIGHT panel (configuration):
- bg-white (or bg-muted/30) with p-8 lg:p-10
- Scrollable independently of left panel (overflow-y-auto)

Step indicators:
- Progress bar (not circles or badges) — unique to ecommerce tier
- Full-width bar: bg-muted rounded-full h-2
- Fill: bg-gradient-to-r from-coral to-peach, width animates to (currentStep/totalSteps * 100)%
- Step labels below: "Store Setup", "Features & Support", "Launch" — text-sm
- Active label: text-coral font-semibold
- Completed labels: text-navy
- Upcoming: text-muted-foreground

Step content:
- Option groups: bg-white rounded-2xl border border-border p-6 (if on muted bg) or just clean white with subtle dividers
- Group headers: text-lg font-semibold text-navy, icon in navy (not coral — business feel)
- Option buttons: bg-muted/50 border border-border rounded-xl, text-navy when unselected
- Selected state: bg-navy text-white (inverted — not coral like other tiers, reinforces business/data feel)
- Lift+shadow hover: whileHover y: -4, boxShadow "0 12px 24px rgba(5, 23, 51, 0.1)"
- Grid: md:grid-cols-2 for most, payment gateways in flex-wrap

Step headings — results-driven:
- Step 1: "Build Your Foundation" (not "Store Configuration")
- Step 2: "Add Growth Tools" (not "Features & Support")
- Step 3 transitions to confirmation

**Section 3: Confirmation (navy bg, py-28 md:py-36)**
- Dark confirmation section
- When user reaches step 3, the right panel shows launch confirmation
- Left panel stays visible with final price
- Rocket or TrendingUp icon with gradient background (coral to peach)
- "Ready to Launch" heading in white, text-3xl
- Breakdown: show 3 key stats — "Features: X selected", "Languages: X", "Support: X months"
- Total: text-5xl text-coral
- CTA: "Launch Your Store" — bg-gradient-to-r from-coral to-peach text-white rounded-xl px-8 py-4 text-lg
- On hover: shadow + lift
- Secondary: "Adjust Configuration" text link in white/50

**Animation variants (replace containerVariants/itemVariants):**
```
const growthFadeIn = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    x: 0,
    transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 15 }
  }
};

const growthStagger = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 }
  }
};

const growthItem = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 200, damping: 20 }
  }
};
```

Step transitions: AnimatePresence mode="wait". Enter from right (x: 40), exit to left (x: -20), spring physics. Left panel content updates with layout animation (no harsh transitions).

**data-cursor attributes:**
- Feature cards: data-cursor="card"
- Option buttons: data-cursor="button"
- CTA buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Step labels: data-cursor="button"

**Mobile responsiveness:**
- Split-screen collapses to single column (grid-cols-1)
- Left panel (summary) becomes a compact sticky bar at top of calculator section:
  - Fixed/sticky with bg-navy p-4, shows only total price and step indicator
  - Expandable: tap to see full breakdown (slide down animation)
- Right panel: full-width below the sticky summary
- Option grids: 1-col on mobile, 2-col on md+
- Hero text: text-4xl on mobile
- Progress bar: full width on mobile

Keep Breadcrumb, Header, Footer imports. Use MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" wrapper.

Present all 4 redesigned pricing pages for human visual verification. Start the dev server if not running and provide URLs for each page. Human verifies that each tier page looks visually distinct from the others — different layout structures, different hover patterns, different animation speeds, different section rhythms, and different copy personalities.
  </action>
  <verify>
Human visits all 4 URLs and confirms visual differentiation:
1. http://localhost:3000/pricing — overview gateway
2. http://localhost:3000/pricing/social — bold/playful
3. http://localhost:3000/pricing/website — crafted/premium
4. http://localhost:3000/pricing/ecommerce — revenue/growth
  </verify>
  <done>
Human has confirmed all 4 pricing pages are visually distinct with no two pages looking like they came from the same template. All calculators functional. Mobile responsive. Phase 5 success criteria met.
