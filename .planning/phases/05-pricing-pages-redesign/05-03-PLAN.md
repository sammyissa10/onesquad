<objective>
Redesign the website pricing calculator (/pricing/website) with a crafted, premium personality — smooth animations, generous whitespace, and confident copy. The layout keeps the sidebar+main structure but refines it with luxury spacing and elegant visual treatments.

Purpose: Website projects are the mid-to-high tier offering. The page should feel like commissioning a bespoke craftsman — deliberate, quality-focused, unhurried. Slower animations, more breathing room, premium feel. This contrasts directly with social's fast/playful energy and ecommerce's data-driven approach.

Output: Completely redesigned `src/app/pricing/website/page.tsx` with premium personality, glow hover effects, refined sidebar layout, and confident copy.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign website calculator with crafted/premium personality</name>
  <files>src/app/pricing/website/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely rewrite `src/app/pricing/website/page.tsx` while preserving all calculator state logic (designComplexity, pageOptions, cmsOptions, additionalServices, specialFeatures, languageOptions, supportPlans, deliveryTimes, BASE_PRICE, settings state, toggleAdditional, calculateTotal).

**CRITICAL: Preserve all state management and calculation logic exactly as-is.** Only change the visual presentation layer.

**Personality: Crafted/Premium**
- Energy: Smooth, deliberate, unhurried
- Animation timing: duration 0.5-0.6s, ease [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1] (custom cubic-bezier), stagger 0.15s
- Hover pattern: Glow (boxShadow "0 0 80px rgba(226, 121, 94, 0.3)") on ALL interactive option cards
- Copy tone: Confident, premium ("Craft your digital presence", "Every pixel, intentional", "Designed to convert")

**Layout Structure: Sidebar summary + spacious main area**
Keep the sidebar+main grid but REFINE it:
- `grid lg:grid-cols-[340px_1fr] gap-12` (wider sidebar, more gap than current 300px/gap-8)
- Sidebar: elegant with subtle border, no heavy shadow
- Main area: generous padding (p-10), lots of whitespace between option groups

**Section 1: Hero (navy bg, py-32 md:py-40)**
- Dark hero with the most generous spacing of all three tiers
- bg-navy with subtle radial gradient overlay (radial-gradient circle at 30% 70%, navy-light/20, transparent)
- Globe icon: larger (w-24 h-24), thin coral stroke outline (not filled bg), centered
- Headline: "Craft Your Digital Presence" — text-5xl md:text-6xl xl:text-7xl, white, font-heading
- Coral accent on "Presence"
- Subtext: "Every pixel placed with purpose. Every interaction designed to convert." — text-xl, white/70
- Subtle thin horizontal line below subtext (w-24 h-px bg-coral/30 mx-auto) as an elegant divider
- No rushed energy — the hero should feel like a deep breath before starting

**Section 2: Calculator (white bg, py-28 md:py-36)**
- Light calculator section (contrasts with dark hero)
- The most spacious calculator of all three tiers

Sidebar summary:
- bg-white border border-border/50 rounded-3xl p-8 (not p-6)
- Title: "Your Project" (not "Summary") in text-2xl font-heading text-navy
- Globe icon next to title, coral colored
- Base price display: elegant, not boxed — just "Starting at" in small text above "$700" in text-3xl
- Line items: each on its own line with generous spacing (space-y-3), navy text, subtle divider lines
- Total: separated by a coral gradient line (h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-coral to-peach)
- Total display: "Total Investment" label, then the price in text-4xl font-bold text-coral
- "one-time" label in text-sm text-muted-foreground
- Glow effect on sidebar on hover (the entire sidebar card glows subtly)

Step indicators:
- Numbered badges in rounded-xl (not circles) — more architectural, premium feel
- Active: bg-white border-2 border-coral text-coral with glow shadow (boxShadow "0 0 30px rgba(226, 121, 94, 0.3)")
- Completed: bg-coral/10 border border-coral/20 text-coral
- Upcoming: bg-muted border border-border text-muted-foreground
- Size: w-12 h-12 with number inside
- Connected with a thin line between them (before/after pseudo or flex with dividers)

Step content:
- Option groups: bg-muted/30 rounded-2xl p-6 with generous internal spacing
- Group headers: text-lg font-semibold text-navy with icon in coral (not accent)
- Option buttons: bg-white border border-border rounded-xl, text-navy when unselected
- Selected state: bg-coral/5 border-coral text-coral (subtle, not bold fill)
- Glow hover on each option: whileHover boxShadow "0 0 40px rgba(226, 121, 94, 0.15)" — subtle, not dramatic
- Grid: md:grid-cols-2 for most groups, with generous gap-4

Step headings — confident:
- Step 1: "Define Your Vision" (not "Website Configuration")
- Step 2: "Add Expertise" (not "Services & Support")
- Step 3 transitions to confirmation view

**Section 3: Confirmation (navy bg, py-24 md:py-32)**
- Dark confirmation section
- When user reaches step 3, the main area transforms to a centered confirmation
- Elegant check icon: thin stroke circle with check, coral color, animated draw-in (not bouncing)
- "Your Vision, Priced" heading in white, text-3xl
- "Total investment:" in white/60, then price in text-5xl text-coral
- CTA: "Begin Your Project" — white outline button with coral hover fill, rounded-xl (not rounded-full — premium feel)
- Secondary: "Refine Your Choices" text link in white/50, goes back to step 1

**Animation variants (replace containerVariants/itemVariants):**
```
const premiumFadeIn = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 40 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1] }
  }
};

const premiumStagger = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.15 }
  }
};

const premiumItem = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.5, ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1] }
  }
};
```

Step transitions: AnimatePresence mode="wait". Enter from bottom (y: 40, opacity: 0), exit to top (y: -20, opacity: 0), duration 0.4s. Notably SLOWER than social's 0.2s transitions.

**data-cursor attributes:**
- Option cards/buttons: data-cursor="card"
- CTA buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Navigation buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Step indicators: data-cursor="button"

**Mobile responsiveness:**
- Sidebar stacks above main content on mobile (lg:grid-cols-1)
- Sidebar becomes a collapsible summary (click to expand/collapse) on mobile to save space
- Option grids: 1-col on mobile, 2-col on md+
- Step indicators: horizontal row, smaller (w-10 h-10)
- Hero text: text-4xl on mobile
- Generous padding scales proportionally (p-6 on mobile, p-10 on desktop)

Keep Breadcrumb, Header, Footer imports. Use MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" wrapper.

Run `npx next build` — page compiles. Visit /pricing/website — hero is dark navy with generous spacing, calculator section is light with sidebar+main layout. Sidebar shows real-time price breakdown. Step indicators are numbered badges (not circles). Option buttons have subtle glow on hover. Navigate between steps — smooth, unhurried transitions. Step 3 shows elegant confirmation on dark background. Mobile: sidebar collapses/stacks, grids go single-column.
