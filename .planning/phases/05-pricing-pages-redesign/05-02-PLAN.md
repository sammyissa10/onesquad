<objective>
Redesign the social media pricing calculator (/pricing/social) with a bold, playful personality — fast energy, snappy animations, and casual copy. The layout should be fundamentally different from the other two tiers: full-width steps with an inline summary (not the sidebar+main grid used by website/ecommerce).

Purpose: Social media is the most accessible, lowest-barrier tier. Its visual personality should reflect that — energetic, approachable, no corporate stuffiness. The page should feel like it was built by people who actually run social media, not by accountants.

Output: Completely redesigned `src/app/pricing/social/page.tsx` with distinct layout, animation timing, hover patterns, copy tone, and section rhythm.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign social media calculator with bold/playful personality</name>
  <files>src/app/pricing/social/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Completely rewrite `src/app/pricing/social/page.tsx` while preserving all calculator state logic (platforms, postFrequency, contentTypes, engagementServices, contractLength, supportLevel, BASE_PRICE, settings state, toggle functions, calculateTotal function).

**CRITICAL: Preserve all state management and calculation logic exactly as-is.** Only change the visual presentation layer.

**Personality: Bold/Playful**
- Energy: Fast, snappy, youthful
- Animation timing: duration 0.2s, bounce easing, stagger 0.05s
- Hover pattern: Scale (whileHover scale: 1.05) on ALL interactive option cards
- Copy tone: Casual, playful ("Pick your vibe", "Choose your flavor", "Let's build your feed")

**Layout Structure: Full-width steps with inline summary (NOT sidebar)**
This is the KEY differentiator from website/ecommerce tiers. Replace the current `grid lg:grid-cols-[300px_1fr]` sidebar layout with:

1. Full-width step content area
2. Inline summary bar below the options (sticky at bottom on mobile, inline on desktop)
3. This creates a vertical flow that feels faster and more social-media-like (think Instagram story format — sequential, full-width)

**Section 1: Hero (white/peach bg, py-20 md:py-28)**
- Light hero (contrasts with website's dark hero and ecommerce's gradient hero)
- bg-gradient-to-br from-white to-peach/10 for subtle warmth
- Social platform icons scattered decoratively (absolute positioned, low opacity)
- Oversized headline: "Build Your Social Empire" or "Own Every Feed" — text-5xl md:text-6xl xl:text-7xl
- Coral accent on key word
- Subtext: playful, casual — "Pick platforms. Add content. Get a price. It's that easy."
- Share2 icon integrated naturally, not in a boxed container

**Section 2: Calculator (navy bg, py-24 md:py-32)**
- Dark calculator section (contrasts with light hero)
- White text, glass-morphism cards for option groups

Step indicators:
- Filled circles with bounce animation (not numbered badges)
- Active: bg-coral, scale 1.1 with spring animation
- Completed: bg-coral/30
- Upcoming: bg-white/10
- Bounce on step change: transition type "spring" stiffness 400 damping 15

Step content cards (option groups):
- bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10 rounded-2xl p-6
- Option buttons: bg-white/10 when unselected, bg-coral when selected
- Text: white/70 unselected, white selected
- Scale hover (whileHover scale: 1.05) on each option button
- Grid layouts per option: platforms 2x2 on mobile / 4-col on desktop, frequency 2x2, content types 2x2, engagement 2x2

Step headings — playful:
- Step 1: "Pick Your Platforms" (not "Choose Your Platforms")
- Step 2: "Add the Good Stuff" (not "Content & Engagement")
- Step 3: "Lock It In" (not "Contract & Support")

Inline summary (replaces sidebar):
- Positioned after the step content, not beside it
- Sticky at bottom of viewport on mobile (fixed bottom-0 with slide-up animation)
- On desktop: full-width bar below the wizard, bg-white/10 rounded-2xl p-6
- Shows: base price + selected additions in a horizontal flow
- Total price: text-4xl font-bold text-coral with AnimatePresence for price change animation
- "per month" label below
- On price change: number scales up briefly (scale 1.1 -> 1.0 spring animation)

**Section 3: Confirmation (white bg, py-20 md:py-28)**
- Light section for the step 3 CTA area
- When user reaches step 3, show confirmation with playful energy
- Large coral check icon with bounce-in animation
- "You're All Set!" heading (not "Your Quote is Ready!")
- Show the calculated total prominently with coral color
- "Your monthly investment: $X/mo" — not "estimated cost"
- CTA: "Let's Make It Happen" coral button, rounded-full, with arrow icon
- Secondary link: "Or tweak your picks" button that goes back to step 1

**Animation variants (replace containerVariants/itemVariants):**
```
const socialFadeIn = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    scale: 1,
    transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: "easeOut" }
  }
};

const socialStagger = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.05 }
  }
};

const socialItem = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    scale: 1,
    transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 20 }
  }
};
```

Step transitions: Use AnimatePresence with mode="wait" for step changes. Enter from right (x: 30), exit to left (x: -30), duration 0.2s.

**data-cursor attributes:**
- Platform cards: data-cursor="card"
- Option buttons: data-cursor="button"
- CTA buttons: data-cursor="button"
- Navigation buttons: data-cursor="button"

**Mobile responsiveness:**
- All grids collapse to 2-col or 1-col on mobile
- Summary bar: fixed bottom-0 on mobile with safe-area padding, slides up when visible
- Step indicators: smaller (w-8 h-8) on mobile
- Hero text scales down to text-4xl on mobile
- Padding reduces proportionally

Keep Breadcrumb, Header, Footer imports. Keep MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" wrapper.

Run `npx next build` — page compiles. Visit /pricing/social — hero is light with playful copy, calculator section is dark (navy), step indicators show filled circles. Select platforms — they highlight with coral bg and scale on hover. Navigate between steps — snappy transitions. Summary shows inline below wizard (not sidebar). Price updates in real-time. Mobile: summary bar sticks to bottom. Step 3 shows playful confirmation with working CTA to /contact.
