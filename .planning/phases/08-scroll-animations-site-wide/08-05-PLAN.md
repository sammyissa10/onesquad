<objective>
Visual verification checkpoint to confirm all scroll animations work correctly across all in-scope pages.

Purpose: Human verification that scroll animations feel smooth, varied, and intentional — not robotic or distracting. This is a subjective quality check that requires a real browser.

Output: Verified scroll animation quality across all pages.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build verification and pre-flight checks</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run pre-flight checks before human verification:

1. `npm run build` — ensure no TypeScript/build errors
2. Grep for remaining Framer Motion scroll patterns in converted files:
   - Check that Hero.tsx, Features.tsx, ServicesPreview.tsx, Comparison.tsx, PortfolioPreview.tsx, Process.tsx, Testimonials.tsx, CTABanner.tsx, ServicesHero.tsx, DigitalMarketingGrid.tsx, WebSolutionsGrid.tsx have NO framer-motion imports (unless needed for interactive animation)
   - Check that ServiceDetailClient.tsx, pricing/page.tsx, portfolio/page.tsx, contact/page.tsx, about/page.tsx have useScrollAnimation imports
3. Verify `src/lib/scrollAnimations.ts` exists and exports preset functions
4. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Report which files still import framer-motion and why (interactive animations that should be kept)

Expected remaining Framer Motion usage (interactive, NOT scroll):
- HomeFAQ.tsx: AnimatePresence for accordion
- pricing/page.tsx: AnimatePresence for FAQ accordion + motion.div layoutId for tab indicator
- portfolio/page.tsx: AnimatePresence for filter transition
- contact/page.tsx: motion.div for success state (maybe)
- Various UI components (Button, ChatWidget, ScrollToTop, etc.) — NOT in scope
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds. Dev server starts. Report of remaining Framer Motion usage is documented.</verify>
  <done>Build passes, dev server running, Framer Motion audit complete showing only interactive animation usage remains.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of scroll animations across all pages</name>
  <action>
Human verifies that all scroll animations work correctly across all in-scope pages by visually inspecting each page in the browser.
  </action>
  <verify>Human confirms animations are smooth, varied, and intentional.</verify>
  <done>All scroll animations verified as smooth, varied, and respecting reduced motion.</done>
  <what-built>Replaced uniform Framer Motion fadeIn scroll animations with varied GSAP ScrollTrigger reveals across all in-scope pages: homepage (9 sections), services overview (4 sections), service detail (7 sections), pricing overview (4 sections), portfolio (3 sections), contact (3 sections), about (5 sections).</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser. For each page, scroll through slowly and check:

**Homepage (/):**
1. Hero: bento grid blocks stagger in on load (not all at once)
2. Features: cards scale in individually as you scroll to them
3. ServicesPreview: cards fade up with stagger, web solutions and marketing categories animate separately
4. Comparison: left column slides from left, right from right, divider grows with scroll
5. PortfolioPreview: heading reveals, cards stagger in
6. Process: timeline steps alternate sliding from left/right
7. Testimonials: cards pop in with varied timing (not uniform)
8. CTABanner: text cascades in (heading first, then subtext, then buttons)
9. FAQ: accordion still opens/closes smoothly

**Services Overview (/services):**
10. Hero: headline sweeps up dramatically
11. DM grid: cards stagger from center
12. WS bento: hero card scales in, smaller cards stagger
13. CTA: fades up

**Service Detail (/services/web-design):**
14. Multiple sections animate with different effects as you scroll
15. FAQ accordion still works

**Pricing (/pricing):**
16. Hero: text cascades in
17. Tier cards: scale in with stagger
18. Hosting cards: fade up with stagger
19. Tab switching still has spring animation
20. FAQ accordion still works

**Portfolio (/portfolio):**
21. Hero: text animates in
22. Grid cards: stagger in
23. Filter buttons: click and grid transitions smoothly
24. CTA: fades up

**Contact (/contact):**
25. Hero: text fades up
26. Sidebar slides from left, form from right
27. Form is fully functional (submit works)

**About (/about):**
28. Hero: headline sweeps up dramatically
29. Story: columns slide in from opposite sides
30. Values: large typography statements sweep up boldly
31. Editorial: subtle entrance
32. CTA: cascades in

**Cross-cutting checks:**
33. Scroll speed: animations trigger at appropriate times (not too early, not too late)
34. No jank: animations are smooth at 60fps
35. Variety: no two adjacent sections have identical animation
36. Hover effects: all card/button hovers still work
37. Mobile: resize browser to mobile width — animations still work, no horizontal overflow
38. Reduced motion: Enable prefers-reduced-motion in DevTools — all content visible, no animations play
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if scroll animations feel smooth and varied across all pages, or describe specific issues to fix.</resume-signal>

Phase 8 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. Uniform Framer Motion fadeIn replaced with varied GSAP scroll reveals across all in-scope pages
2. List and grid scroll reveals use varied stagger timing (0.05-0.1s delay, not uniform stagger(0.1))
3. Scroll animations feel smooth and intentional (not distracting or janky)
4. All scroll animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Human confirms scroll animations are smooth and varied
- All 4 phase success criteria verified
- No broken interactive animations (accordions, filters, tab indicators, forms)
- Build passes with no errors
</success_criteria>
