<objective>
Convert portfolio, contact, and about pages from Framer Motion to varied GSAP ScrollTrigger animations, each matching the page's established personality.

Purpose: Complete the scroll animation rollout across all remaining in-scope pages. Portfolio gets grid-aware staggers, Contact gets asymmetric directional reveals, About gets dramatic typography entrances matching its manifesto editorial feel.

Output: 3 page files converted with personality-matched GSAP scroll animations.

  <name>Task 1: Convert Portfolio page to GSAP ScrollTrigger</name>
  <files>src/app/portfolio/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Convert the portfolio page (252 lines) from Framer Motion to GSAP ScrollTrigger.

Current state: Uses containerVariants/itemVariants (staggerChildren: 0.08, fadeIn with y:30). Uses useInView, AnimatePresence for filter transitions.

Portfolio page personality: Bold, confident, work-speaks-for-itself. The masonry grid is the star.

**Dark Hero Section:**
- Remove motion.div initial/animate/transition
- Use useScrollAnimation: headline fadeUp with y:40, duration:0.7, hero trigger
- Badge (project count): scaleReveal with 0.1s delay
- Subtitle: fadeUp with 0.2s delay

**Grid Section (white):**
- Remove containerVariants/itemVariants, useInView
- Sticky filter bar: Do NOT animate — it's a navigation element that should be immediately available
- Masonry grid cards: Staggered fadeUp with 0.06s each (dense grid = faster stagger per research). Use trigger on grid container at TRIGGERS.late
- CRITICAL: The grid re-renders when filter changes (activeGroup state). The AnimatePresence with `key={activeGroup}` handles filter transitions. This is interactive animation, NOT scroll animation. Handle this carefully:
  - KEEP AnimatePresence wrapping the grid for filter switching
  - For the initial scroll entrance, use useScrollAnimation to animate cards on first appearance
  - After filter change, cards should appear without scroll animation (they're already in view). The AnimatePresence exit/enter handles the transition. Consider using a ref flag to skip scroll animation after initial load, OR simply animate via scroll only on initial load and let filter changes show cards immediately.
  - Simplest approach: Remove motion.div animation from individual cards (variants={itemVariants}) and replace with GSAP scroll animation on mount. For filter changes, let AnimatePresence handle fade in/out. This means: keep the AnimatePresence wrapper with key={activeGroup}, but inside it, use plain divs for cards (not motion.div with variants).
- Popular cards (col-span-2): same animation as regular cards, stagger handles the visual rhythm
- Empty state: simple fadeUp

**Dark CTA Section:**
- Heading: fadeUp with standard trigger
- Subtitle: fadeUp with 0.15s delay
- Buttons: fadeUp with 0.3s delay

Implementation:
- Remove `import { motion, useInView, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion"` — BUT keep AnimatePresence IF it's used for filter transitions. If so: `import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion"` and keep only the filter-switching AnimatePresence/motion usage.
- Actually, review the current code: AnimatePresence wraps `<motion.div key={activeGroup}>` for filter transitions. You need motion.div here for the exit animation. KEEP this specific motion.div + AnimatePresence for filter switching. Remove all other motion.div usage.
- Remove containerVariants, itemVariants objects
- Use useScrollAnimation for scroll entrance animations
- Keep the filter state management (useState, handlers) unchanged
- Keep PortfolioCard component unchanged (it's imported, not modified)

Run `npm run build` — no TypeScript errors. Visit /portfolio — hero animates on load, cards stagger in on scroll, filter switching still transitions smoothly. CTA section animates on scroll.
  </verify>
  <done>Portfolio page uses GSAP for scroll entrance, keeps AnimatePresence for filter transitions. Cards stagger with fast timing (0.06s). Hero/CTA have distinct fadeUp timing.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Convert Contact and About pages to GSAP ScrollTrigger</name>
  <files>
    src/app/contact/page.tsx
    src/app/about/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Convert the contact and about pages from Framer Motion to GSAP ScrollTrigger, each matching their established personality.

**Contact Page (434 lines)** — Personality: warm, inviting, asymmetric
Current state: Framer Motion motion.div with initial/animate on hero (stagger), sidebar (x:-20), form area (x:20), quote card, success state.

Sections and target animations:
1. **Dark Hero:** Headline and subtitle stagger with fadeUp (y:30), hero trigger. Remove the motion.div stagger wrapper.
2. **Form + Sidebar section:** This is the key asymmetric reveal.
   - Sidebar (left, 4-col): slideFromLeft with standard trigger on the grid container
   - Form area (right, 8-col): slideFromRight with 0.15s delay, same trigger
   - This creates a satisfying "panels opening" effect matching the asymmetric layout
3. **Quote summary card:** If quoteData exists, it animates with scaleReveal when visible. Keep the existing motion.div for the quote card's initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.98 }} / animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }} — this is a conditional mount animation (appears when localStorage has data), not a scroll animation. OR convert to GSAP if simpler.
4. **Success state:** Keep the motion.div for success animation (conditional render on form submit) — this is interactive, not scroll.
5. **Dark CTA:** fadeUp cascade (heading, text, buttons with delays)

What to keep as Framer Motion:
- Success state animation (motion.div initial/animate on submit) — only renders on form submit
- Quote summary card entrance (conditional render)
- If these are simple enough, convert them to CSS animations or GSAP. Use your judgment.

What to definitely remove:
- Hero stagger animations (motion.div with variants)
- Sidebar initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }} animate pattern
- Form area initial={{ opacity: 0, x: 20 }} animate pattern
- CTA section animations

Implementation:
- Use useScrollAnimation with scope on the main element
- Target sections by class names
- The form itself should NOT be animated beyond the initial entrance — form fields, submit button, error states should be immediately responsive
- Contact info items (email, location, hours): stagger with fadeUp, 0.1s each
- Quick response badge: scaleReveal with delay

**About Page (239 lines)** — Personality: editorial manifesto, typography-driven, dramatic
Current state: Framer Motion with MotionConfig reducedMotion="user", useInView, motion.div whileInView on each section.

This is the most dramatic page for scroll animations. The typography-driven values section NEEDS impressive entrance effects.

Sections and target animations:
1. **Dark Hero (mission-first):** Headline fadeUp with y:60, duration:1.0, power3 ease — the most dramatic entrance of any page. Subtitle fadeUp with 0.3s delay. Remove useInView/motion.div, MotionConfig.

2. **Logo Origin Story (light):** Grid reveal — story text column slideFromLeft, brand mark column slideFromRight. Uses a single trigger on the grid container. Remove useInView ref/animate pattern.

3. **Values Typography Statements (dark) — THE SHOWPIECE:**
   - Each value block (3 total) gets its own ScrollTrigger
   - Headlines (text-5xl to text-[5.5rem]): `gsap.from(headline, { opacity: 0, y: 80, duration: 1.0, ease: 'power3.out', scrollTrigger: { trigger: headline, start: 'top 75%' } })` — large y offset for dramatic sweep-up
   - Subtitle text: fadeUp with 0.3s delay after headline
   - Use `gsap.utils.toArray('.about-value')` to loop through all three value blocks
   - This section should feel like a manifesto unfolding — each value statement commands attention as you scroll to it

4. **What Makes Us Different (peach/10):** Heading fadeUp, paragraph blocks stagger with 0.15s each. Subtle, not dramatic — let the values section be the star.

5. **Manifesto Closer / CTA (dark):** fadeUp cascade with increasing delays (heading, text, buttons). Scale heading from 0.9 for subtle emphasis.

Implementation:
- Remove MotionConfig wrapper entirely
- Remove useInView, useRef for animation (keep if used for other purposes)
- Remove all motion.div elements, replace with div + targeting classes
- Use useScrollAnimation with scope on main element
- Add data-animate to all scroll-animated elements
- Keep all content, layout, and Tailwind unchanged

Run `npm run build` — no TypeScript errors. Visit /contact — sidebar slides from left, form from right. Visit /about — values headlines sweep up dramatically, story columns slide in from opposite sides. No framer-motion scroll patterns remain (interactive animations may stay).
  </verify>
  <done>Contact page uses asymmetric slide-in for form layout, GSAP for all scroll sections. About page uses dramatic fadeUp for values manifesto, directional slide for story grid. Both pages match their established personalities.</done>

1. `npm run build` completes without errors
2. Visit /portfolio — hero animates, grid cards stagger in, filter switching still works, CTA animates
3. Visit /contact — hero animates, sidebar/form slide in from opposite sides, form is functional, CTA animates
4. Visit /about — hero is dramatic, story columns slide in, values sweep up boldly, editorial section is subtle, CTA cascades
5. All three pages respect prefers-reduced-motion
6. Contact form still submits correctly (animation changes don't affect form behavior)
7. Portfolio filter transitions still work (AnimatePresence preserved)

<success_criteria>
- 3 files modified (portfolio, contact, about pages)
- Portfolio: grid-aware stagger + preserved filter transitions
- Contact: asymmetric directional reveals matching layout personality
- About: dramatic typography entrances for values manifesto
- Interactive animations preserved where needed (filters, form submit, success state)
