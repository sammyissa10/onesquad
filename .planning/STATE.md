# State: OneSquad Visual Overhaul

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Milestone v1.0 started

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Every page should feel intentionally designed — no two sections should look like they came from the same template.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.0 — Visual Overhaul

## Accumulated Context

- Codebase mapped: 7 reference docs in .planning/codebase/
- Audit findings: 30+ identical gradients, 39+ identical card styles, 12+ identical heading sizes, 7+ identical section structures
- Copy tone already de-AI'd in prior work, but visual patterns remain templated
- Inspiration: kota.co.uk (asymmetric layouts, scroll animations), strangepixels.co (custom cursor, dark theme)

## Key Decisions

(None yet — milestone just started)

## Blockers

(None)
