## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- GSAP alongside Framer Motion: ScrollTrigger needed for pinning, parallax, timeline control
- Full custom cursor sitewide: Both inspiration sites use cursor as design element
- Strategic dark sections (not full dark mode): High contrast transitions create rhythm and drama
- Homepage + key pages first: Nail design system on most important pages, then extend
- Full copy refresh: Edgy creative vibe needs copy that matches
- **01-01:** Use syncTouch instead of non-existent smoothTouch option (Lenis 1.3.17 API uses syncTouch + syncTouchLerp)

### Pending Todos
