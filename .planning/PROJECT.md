# OneSquad — Visual Overhaul

## What This Is

A full visual and structural overhaul of the OneSquad digital agency website. The current site works but looks AI-generated — repetitive card styles, identical section structures, generic gradients, safe typography, and predictable animations. The goal is to make it feel hand-crafted, edgy, and creative — like a design-forward agency built it, not a template.

## Core Value

Every page should feel intentionally designed — no two sections should look like they came from the same template. The site must feel like it was built by people who care about craft, not generated by a machine.

## Requirements

### Validated

- Site is live and functional (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion)
- Pages exist: homepage, services, pricing (3 sub-pages), portfolio, contact, about, blog, case studies, templates, privacy, terms
- Contact form submits via API route
- Newsletter subscription via API route
- Responsive across breakpoints
- Dark/light theme provider exists

### Active

- [ ] Break the identical section structure across all pages
- [ ] Add GSAP with ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animations (pinning, parallax, timelines)
- [ ] Implement full custom cursor that reacts to hovered elements
- [ ] Create strategic dark/light section alternation for visual contrast
- [ ] Redesign homepage with asymmetric, non-grid layouts (Kota-inspired)
- [ ] Redesign services page with unique section treatments
- [ ] Redesign pricing pages with distinct visual approaches per tier
- [ ] Redesign portfolio page with masonry/mixed-size project cards
- [ ] Replace uniform card styling with varied, context-specific components
- [ ] Replace generic gradients with bold, intentional color usage
- [ ] Vary typography — mixed weights, oversized text, display treatments
- [ ] Add video/motion elements to project and service cards
- [ ] Create unique testimonial treatments (individual colors/layouts, not identical cards)
- [ ] Add numbered/narrative section structures where appropriate
- [ ] Rewrite all copy — headlines and body — to match edgy creative tone
- [ ] Vary spacing and rhythm intentionally (not uniform py-16 everywhere)
- [ ] Replace stagger(0.1) fadeIn everywhere with diverse, scroll-driven animations
- [ ] Add hover micro-interactions beyond y: -8 on cards

### Out of Scope

- New pages or features — this is a visual/structural overhaul of existing pages
- Backend changes — API routes stay as-is
- Blog/case studies content — template pages only, no content creation
- Mobile app — web only
- CMS integration — static content is fine for now
- SEO overhaul — keep existing metadata, just update copy where it changes

## Context

- Site is brownfield: Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Codebase mapped in `.planning/codebase/` — 7 reference documents
- Recent work de-AI'd the copy tone, but visual patterns remain templated
- Audit identified: 30+ identical gradient instances, 39+ identical card styles, 12+ identical heading sizes, 7+ sections with identical structure
- Inspiration sites: kota.co.uk (asymmetric layouts, scroll animations, bento grids, video cards), strangepixels.co (custom cursor, dark theme with bold accents, scroll-driven motion)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind — no framework changes. Add GSAP alongside Framer Motion.
- **Pages in scope**: Homepage, services, pricing (3 sub-pages), portfolio, contact, about — not blog/case-studies/templates/legal
- **Performance**: GSAP + scroll animations must not tank Core Web Vitals. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- **Color palette**: Keep navy/coral/peach base but use it boldly and unpredictably. Add edge, not new colors.
- **Existing functionality**: Contact form, newsletter, navigation, routing — all must continue working.

## Current Milestone: v1.0 Visual Overhaul

**Goal:** Transform every key page from templated AI-generated patterns to hand-crafted, design-forward layouts with scroll-driven animations, bold typography, and intentional visual rhythm.

**Target features:**
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger animation foundation (pinning, parallax, timelines)
- Custom cursor as a design element
- Strategic dark/light section alternation
- Asymmetric, non-grid layouts (homepage-first, then extend)
- Varied typography, card styles, spacing, and color usage
- Full copy refresh matching edgy creative tone
- Hover micro-interactions and motion elements

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Add GSAP alongside Framer Motion | ScrollTrigger needed for pinning, parallax, timeline control that Framer Motion can't do well | -- Pending |
| Full custom cursor sitewide | Both inspiration sites use cursor as a design element, not just a pointer | -- Pending |
| Strategic dark sections (not full dark mode) | Kota approach — high contrast transitions between sections create rhythm and drama | -- Pending |
| Homepage + key pages first | Nail the design system on the most important pages, then extend | -- Pending |
| Full copy refresh | Edgy creative vibe needs copy that matches — safe corporate copy undermines the visual work | -- Pending |
